the owner of a small bookstore asks me for a simple account of her latest sales
Scenario:
Imagine a friend - the owner of a small bookstore - asks you for a simple account of their latest sales. It provides you with a simple Json export file.

What do you have to do?
- Design of a database schema for optimized storage
- Read the Json data and save it in the database with php
- Create a simple page with filters for employee name, event name and date
- Output of the filtered results in a table below the filter
- Adding a last line for the total price of all filtered entries

Additional Information:
The external system changed the time zone of the event date.
Before version 1.0.17 + 60 it was Europe / Berlin.
After that it's UTC. Please provide a tested class for the version comparison.
